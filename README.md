# WeaponSystem

The weapon system is a dynamic and flexible solution for managing weapons in Unity-based games. It features two main types of weapons: melee and firearms, with the option to add additional types as needed. Each weapon has unique properties, such as damage and name, that are shared across all types. However, each type of weapon also has its own unique set of properties, like the number of bullets for firearms, that distinguish it from others.

One of the most exciting features of the weapon system is its flexibility in terms of gameplay. Each type of weapon is handled differently, providing a unique experience for players when they use them. For example, melee weapons like knives and swords may require players to be in close proximity to enemies, while firearms provide ranged combat options.

The system also features a user-friendly UI that displays the name of the currently selected weapon, making it easy for players to switch between weapons during gameplay. To use a weapon, players simply left-click on it, triggering a Debug.Log message. To select the next weapon, players can right-click, making the system intuitive and easy to use.

Overall, the weapon system provides developers with a powerful tool for managing weapons in their games. With its flexible design and unique gameplay options, it's an excellent choice for developers looking to create engaging and dynamic combat experiences.
